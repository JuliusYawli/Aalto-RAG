FOUNDATION
Why ICT Engineers Should Care
Operational Efficiency
Automate network diagnostics, incident response, and 
system optimization
Compliance & Security
Streamline regulatory compliance, risk assessment, and 
documentation
Engineering Productivity
Accelerate code reviews, testing, and technical 
documentation
Innovation Edge
Build intelligent systems that understand context and take 
action

FUNDAMENTALS
What is a Large Language Model?
• Neural network trained on massive text datasets
• Unidirectional= Predicts next token /  Bidirectional = They can see the words before&after, are used more for understanding.    
• Generative AI: summarize, explain, extract structure
• Key insight: LLM = probabilistic reasoning engine
Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out by Andrew Karpathy 
Proprietary LLMs
Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic), GPT (OpenAI)
Open Source Models
Llama, Mistral, Phi - deploy on your infrastructure

CAPABILITIES
What LLMs Are Good At (and Not)
 Good At
• Summarizing long technical documents
• Simplifying complex engineering concepts
• Extracting information from large datasets
• Helping write reports, code, and 
documentation
 NOT Good At
• Can hallucinate facts
• Not deterministic like circuits
• Must be validated in safety-critical domains
• Need grounding (RAG) for accuracy
Real-World Example: Elisa Stadium Network
A telecom engineer can now say: "Give emergency services the fastest connection right 
now."
The LLM-enabled system understands intent and automatically:
• Prioritizes ambulance communications
• Throttles video streaming for other users
• Allocates special network resources dynamically

TRANSLATION
Engineering Analogy: LLM Concepts for ICT Pros
Tokens
Think: signal samples in a communications system
Prompt
Like input control parameters you'd tune
Hallucination
Equivalent to noise or unstable output
Fine-tuning
Similar to system calibration for domain-specific behavior
Retrieval (RAG)
Acts as an external memory module

ARCHITECTURE
From ChatGPT to AI Products
AI Product = LLM + Engineering System
1
Input
PDF, image, 
Word, raw 
text

OCR, 
chunking, 
cleaning
3
Retrieval
Embeddings + 
vector DB
4
LLM Fine-

5
Agentic AI
Reasoning + 
tool use
6
Output
UI + validation 
layer
Engineering mindset: Treat the LLM as a component in a larger system. Validation, error handling, and observability are 
critical.

AGENTIC SYSTEMS
What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI = LLM + Tools + Workflow Automation
Instead of only answering questions, an AI agent can:
01
Understand a goal
02
Plan steps
03
Use tools
Search, extract, rewrite, execute
04
Verify outputs
05
Deliver actionable results

SPECIALIZATION
Fine-Tuning: Engineering Perspective
Fine-Tuning = Specializing an LLM for a Specific Domain
General LLM (e.g., ChatGPT)
Trained on broad internet text, knows general knowledge
Fine-Tuned LLM
Continues training on specialized data to excel at:
• Your company's technical documentation
• Telecom terminology (3GPP, NR, RAN, network slicing)
• Structured, consistent outputs
• Compliance decision patterns
 Critical: Fine-tuning improves consistency, format, and domain behavior  not factual accuracy. Always validate outputs.

DEMO #2
AI Product Ideation: From Problem to Solution
Building an AI product isn't about starting with the model, it starts with understanding a real problem and delivering value.
01
Identify Real Pain Point
02
Define User & Context
03
Design Desired User Experience
04
Decide What AI Actually Does
05
Add Trust & Safety
06
Build an MVP

AI-Assisted Development Tools
These tools integrate AI directly into the development workflow, offering real-time assistance to engineers. They leverage LLMs to 
understand context, generate code, debug, and provide insights, significantly boosting productivity.
GitHub Copilot
An AI pair programmer providing 
code suggestions, completions, and 
entire function generation directly 
within your IDE.
Cursor and Antigravity
AI-first code editor designed for 
conversational coding, allowing you 
to prompt, debug, and refactor code 
using natural language.
Perplexity AI
An AI-powered answer engine that 
delivers concise summaries and cites 
sources, serving as a powerful 
research tool for developers.

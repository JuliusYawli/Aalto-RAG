07-Training and Fine-Tuning Large Language Models

1. Training LLMs
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Model architecture and initialization

2. Pre-training
- Unsupervised learning on large corpora
- Objectives (e.g., next token prediction)

3. Fine-tuning
- Supervised learning for specific tasks
- Transfer learning

4. Evaluation
- Metrics (accuracy, perplexity, etc.)
- Benchmark datasets

5. Challenges
- Computational resources
- Overfitting and generalization

6. Best Practices
- Data quality
- Regularization techniques

7. Conclusion
- Importance of training and fine-tuning for LLM performance

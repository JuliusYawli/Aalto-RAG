Three types 
of machine 
learning
• Supervised learning
• Given data 𝐷 = {(𝒙𝒊, 𝑦𝑖)}𝑖=1
𝑁 , learn to 
predict the output 𝑦𝑖 using input 𝒙𝒊.
• elements of 𝒙𝒊 are called features, 
attributes, or covariates.
• 𝑦𝑖 is called the response or label.
• Unsupervised learning
• Given only inputs 𝐷 = {𝒙𝒊}𝑖=1
𝑁  
(unlabeled data) the goal is to find 
some “interesting” patterns in the data.
• Reinforcement learning
• Broadly: training an agent to take 
actions that maximize some reward in 
the long term. For example: training a 
robot to escape a maze.

Explain high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional subspace which 
captures the "essential" parts of the original data.

Data matrix (1/2)
• Usually (but not always!) rows are individual data points; columns 
are characteristics of the data points (e.g. measurement, feature, 
attribute, variable, covariate).

Data matrix (2/2)
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 12

--- Page 13 ---
Feature vector
• One row of the data matrix, written as a column vector, represents one 
data point 𝒙𝒊.
• 𝒙𝒊 is called e.g. a feature vector or a representation.
• Everything can not be represented as vectors, but a lot of things can.
• To emphasize that 𝒙𝒊 is a vector, it is often written in bold.
• We assume the following operations to be familiar: vector addition 𝒙 +
𝒚, vector inner product 𝒙𝑻𝒚, vector length (norm) 𝒙 , matrix 
multiplication 𝐴𝒙, matrix addition 𝐴 + 𝐵, matrix product 𝐴𝐵, matrix 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors 𝐴𝒙 = 𝜆𝒙.

Histogram (1/2)
• Histogram is a common way to create features and explore data, 
by dividing values of a variable in different bins.
• Height of a box in a histogram is equal to the number of values in 
the corresponding bin.
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 14

--- Page 15 ---
Histogram (2/2)
• A color histogram of an image shows the number of pixels in each 
color.
• Histograms can be used also for text and audio.

--- Page 17 ---
Text as a vector
• A term-document matrix:
• Rows correspond to text documents, columns corresponds to 
words, and 𝑥𝑖𝑗 is the number of occurrences of word 𝑗 in 
document 𝑖.
• Bag of words feature vector: 𝑥𝑖𝑗 = 1 iff document 𝑖 contains word 
𝑗.
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 17

--- Page 18 ---
Example: student assignments
• Example: A term-document matrix. Word 
frequency ≥0 is represented with a black 
dot.
• Left-ordered form: columns are ordered 
according to appearance of words in 
documents: the first document has more 
than 200 words, the second document 
has also roughly 200 words of which 150 
did not appear in the first, etc.
• Note: the data include a document which 
is almost identical to another document. 
Which one?

tf-idf text representation (term frequency – inverse document frequency)
• The most common words (and, so, ...) can be 
removed manually.
• Words are often weighted according to their 
importance using the inverse document 
frequency.
• where w(word) is the weight, df(word) is the 
document frequency (how many documents have 
the word) and N is the number of documents.
• Word frequencies are multiplied by the 
corresponding weights w.
• For example, the word ”and” which likely appears 
in every document gets weight 0.

Neural network -based text 
representations
• Nowadays, several large neural network 
models, pre-trained with massive data 
sets, have been published for Natural 
Language Processing (NLP).
• or example, BERT learns a vector 
representation for a word, sentence, or 
the whole document.

Example: Countries and capitals
• 2D PCA projection of 1000D word vectors 
learned using skip-gram neural network 
model.
• For example: Madrid - Spain + France = 
Paris

Convolution (1/2)
• Convolution is a generic operation which forms new features as 
the weighted sum of neighboring pixels.
• Weights are defined by a kernel (or filter)
• The output (or feature map) is obtained by multiplying each image patch 
elementwise with the kernel.
• A typical kernel size with image data is 3*3.
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 23

--- Page 24 ---
Convolution (2/2)
• In practice the 
elements of the 
kernel (weights, 
parameters) are not 
set by hand but 
learned from data to 
result in useful 
features.

• A model trained to classify images of digits 0,1,...,9.
• Learned filters and a feature map (after one convolutional
• layer) for an input image of digit 9.

Logistic regression
• Classes might be nominal in real-
world problems.
• Weather: sunny, rainy
• Medical: positive diagnosis, 
negative diagnosis
• Localization: indoor, outdoor
• In such case, classification is binary: 
y ∈ {0, 1}
• Linear regression: h(x) can be 
smaller than 0 or greater than 1
• Logistic regression: 0 ≤ h(x) ≤ 1

Unsupervised learning
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 40
• Supervised: {(x1,1, x1,2) → y1, (x2,1, x2,2) → y2, . . . , (xn,1, xn,2) → yn}
• Unsupervised: {(x1,1, x1,2), (x2,1, x2,2), . . . , (xn,1, xn,2)}

--- Page 41 ---
K-means Algorithm
• Iteratively find k clusters in the data
• Init: Randomly choose k points as initial 
cluster centroids
• Repeat:
• Assign data points xi , i ∈ {1..n} to 
these cluster centroids conditioned 
on distance: Cj = {xi |cj is nearest 
centroid to xi}
• Move cluster centroids to the center 
weight of the points associated to 
them

Data, data, data, ... 
or not (?)
• Use separate data sets
• Feature selection: Identify meaningful features
• Training: Train a model with given features
• Testing: Test a trained model and features
• Model selection: Find a best model given 
features
• Using the same set for multiple purposes 
may result in biased results

Preparation for 
training and testing
• Data scarcity: Most data for training, rest for 
testing
• Diversity: Use several runs with different data 
sets
• Randomness: Avoid deterministic separation 
of data
• Correlation: Training and testing data from 
different sessions where possible
• Domination: Class-sizes during training should 
be equal

Training the model – varying data distributions
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 46
• Builds: Multiple distributions in training and testing data
• Avoid: random generation of training/testing sets from same data 
→ correlation

--- Page 47 ---
Training the model on scarce data: 
Leave-one-out cross-validation
• n-fold cross-validation where n is the 
number of sample instances
• Leave out each instance once; train 
model on remaining instances
• Estimate performance on left-out 
instances (success/failure)
• Caution: Possible correlation from 
data sampled in same condition

Bias and Variance in training a learning model
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 61
• Bias
• Inability of machine learning model to capture the true distribution of the 
data
• Example: Linear model to describe non-linear relationship between data and labels
• e.g. linear regression is expected to have a high bias error; in contrast to other algorithms that take less 
hard assumptions (e.g. decision trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines)
• High bias: more assumption in the learning algorithm on the underlying 
distribution
• Low bias: fewer assumptions in the learning algorithm
--- Page 62 ---
Bias and Variance in training a learning model
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 62
• Variance
• Model overfits on a particular dataset (learning to fit very closely to the 
points of a particular dataset)
• Example: Generally, nonlinear machine learning algorithms like decision trees have 
a high variance
• Low variance algorithms: Linear regression, logistic regression, linear 
discriminant analysis
• High variance algorithms: Decision Trees, k-NN, support vector machines

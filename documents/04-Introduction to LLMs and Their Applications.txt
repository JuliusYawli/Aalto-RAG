Regularization
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 5
• It is common to add a penalty (e.g., quadratic) on weight 
magnitudes to the objective function:
• Quadratic penalty encourages network to use all of its inputs “a little” 
rather than a few inputs “a lot”

LLMs are built out of transformers
• Transformer: a specific kind of network architecture, like a fancier 
feedforward network, but based on attention.

Instead of starting with the big picture
• Let's consider the embeddings for an individual word from a 
particular layer
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 10

--- Page 11 ---
Problem with static embeddings (word2vec)
• They are static! The embedding for a word doesn't reflect how its 
meaning changes in context.
• The chicken didn't cross the road because it was too tired.
• What is the meaning represented in the static embedding for "it"?
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 11
--- Page 12 ---
Contextual Embeddings
• Intuition: a representation of meaning of a word should be 
different in different contexts!
• Contextual Embedding: each word has a different vector that 
expresses different meanings depending on the surrounding 
words.
• How to compute contextual embeddings?
• Attention
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 12
--- Page 13 ---
Contextual Embeddings
• The chicken didn't cross the road because it
• What should be the properties of "it"?
• The chicken didn't cross the road because it was too tired.
• The chicken didn't cross the road because it was too wide.
• At this point in the sentence, it's probably referring to either the 
chicken or the street.
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 13
--- Page 14 ---
Intuition of attention
• Build up the contextual embedding from a word by selectively 
integrating information from all the neighboring words.
• We say that a word "attends to" some neighboring words more 
than others.
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 14

--- Page 15 ---
Attention definition
• A mechanism for helping compute the embedding for a token by 
selectively attending to and integrating information from 
surrounding tokens (at the previous layer).
• More formally: a method for doing a weighted sum of vectors.
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 15

Attention is left-to-right
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 16
--- Page 17 ---
Simplified version of attention: a sum of prior words 
weighted by their similarity with the current word!
• Given a sequence of token embeddings:
• Produce: ai=a weighted sum of x1 through x7 (and xi) weighted by 
their similarity to xi
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 17

Dot product as a metric for similarity
𝐮⋅𝐯=|𝐮||𝐯|cos𝜃
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 18
Suppose 𝑣 = 1. Then, cos 𝜃  defines the directional similarity.

An Actual Attention Head: slightly more complicated
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 20
• High-level idea: instead of using vectors (like xi and x4) directly, 
we'll represent 3 separate roles each vector xi plays:
• Q uery: As the current element being compared to the preceding inputs.
• Key: as a preceding input that is being compared to the current element 
to determine a similarity.
• Value: a value of a preceding element that gets weighted and summed.

An Actual Attention Head: slightly more complicated
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 23
• We'll use matrices to project each vector xi into a representation 
of its role as query, key, value:
• Query: WQ
• Key: WK
• Value: WV

--- Page 24 ---
An Actual Attention Head: slightly more complicated
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 24
• Given these 3 representation of xi
• To compute similarity of current element xi with some prior 
element xj, we use dot product between qi and kj. And instead of 
summing up xj, we sum up vj.

An Actual Attention Head: slightly more complicated
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 26
• Instead of one attention head, we'll have lots of them!
• Intuition: each head might be attending to the context for different 
purposes
• Different linguistic relationships or patterns in the context

Summary
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 28
• Attention is a method for enriching the representation of a token 
by incorporating contextual information.
• The result: the embedding for each word will be different in 
different contexts!
• Contextual embeddings: a representation of word meaning in its 
context.
• We'll see in the next lecture that attention can also be viewed as a 
way to move information from one token to another.

Vanishing (exploding) gradients
• Simply put, the vanishing gradients issue occurs when we use the 
Sigmoid or Tanh activation functions in the hidden layer
• These functions squish a large input space into a small space.

Layer norm: the vector xi is normalized twice
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 34

Layer Norm
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 35
• Layer norm is a variation of the z-score from statistics, applied to a 
single vector in a hidden layer:

Putting together everything in a single transformer block
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 36

--- Page 37 ---
A transformer is a 
stack of these 
blocks
so, all the vectors 
are of the same 
dimensionality d
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 37
--- Page 38 ---
Residual streams and attention
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 38
• Notice that all parts of the transformer block apply to 1 residual 
stream (1 token).
• Except attention, which takes information from other tokens.
• Elhage et al. (2021) show that we can view attention heads as 
literally moving information from the residual stream of a 
neighboring token into the current stream.

Parallelizing computation using X
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 40
• For attention/transformer block we've been computing a single 
output at a single time step i in a single residual stream.
• But we can pack the N tokens of the input sequence into a single 
matrix X of size [N × d].
• Each row of X is the embedding of one token of the input.
• X can have 1k-32k rows, each of the dimensionality of the 
embedding d (the model dimension)

QKT

• Now can do a single matrix multiply to combine Q and K

Parallelizing attention

• Scale the scores, take the softmax, and then multiply the result by 
V resulting in a matrix of shape N × d
• An attention vector for each input taken

Masking out the future
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 43
• What is this mask function?
QKT has a score for each query dot every key, including those that 
follow the query.
• Guessing the next word is pretty simple if you already know it!

--- Page 44 ---
Masking out the 
future
• Add −∞ to cells in upper triangle so 
that softmax turns it to 0.
• Plus, attention is quadratic in length

Token and Position Embeddings
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 48
• The matrix X (of shape [N × d]) has an embedding for each word in 
the context.
• This embedding is created by adding two distinct embedding for 
each input
• token embedding
• positional embedding

Token Embeddings
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 50
• Embedding matrix E has shape [|V | × d ].
• One row for each of the |V | tokens in the vocabulary.
• Each word is a row vector of d dimensions
• Given: string "Thanks for all the”
1. Tokenize with BPE and convert into vocab indices
w = [5,4000,10532,2224]
2. Select the corresponding rows from E, each row an embedding
(row 5, row 4000, row 10532, row 2224)
--- Page 51 ---
Position Embeddings
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 51
• There are many methods, but we'll just describe the simplest: 
absolute position.
• More advanced one at
https://kikaben.com/transformers-positional-encoding/
• Goal: learn a position embedding matrix Epos of shape [1 × N ].
• Start with randomly initialized embeddings
• i.e., just as we have an embedding for token fish, we’ll have an embedding 
for position 3 and position 17.
• As with word embeddings, these position embeddings are learned along 
with other parameters during training.

Each x is just the sum of word and position embeddings.

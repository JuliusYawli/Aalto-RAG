Why this winter school?
• To learn the basic concepts in AI/ML and LLMs.
• To have a theoretical-practical understanding of the LLMs.
• To get exposed to different technologies in LLMs so that you can 
dive deeper after the summer school if you find something more 
interesting.
• To get start writing simple AI/ML applications using 
NoCode/LowCode approaches plus using more advanced 
libraries like LangChain!

A Brief History of 
AI
• The idea of intelligent machines appears in 
ancient myths and early automata (e.g., 
mechanical statues, clockwork devices).
• 1940s–50s: Foundations laid with work on 
cybernetics, formal logic, and early computers.
• 1956: The term Artificial Intelligence was 
coined at the Dartmouth Conference, organized 
by John McCarthy.
• The Dartmouth Conference is considered the 
official birth of AI as a field of study.
• Early AI programs (1950s–60s) tackled tasks like 
playing chess, solving algebra, and proving 
theorems.
• Periods of rapid progress alternated with AI 
winters — times of reduced funding and 
interest.

Turing predicted by 2000 a 
machine would be able to fool 
an average person to believe 
that it’s a real human!
Try it yourself: https://turingtest.live/
A human evaluator interacts (via 
text) with both a machine and a 
human.
The evaluator’s task: decide which is 
the machine and which is the 
human.
A machine passes the test if the 
evaluator cannot reliably tell them 
apart.
Focuses on behavior, not inner 
workings, can the machine imitate 
human responses convincingly?

How do we learn 
a language 
model?
• Estimate probabilities using text data
• Collect a textual corpus
• Find a distribution that maximizes the probability of the corpus 
(maximum likelihood estimation).
• A naive solution: count and divide
• Assume we have N training sentences
• Let x1, x2, ..., xn be a sentence, and c(x1, x2, ..., xn) be the number 
of times it appeared in the training data.
• Define a language model:
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 45
--- Page 46 ---
Markov assumption
• We make the Markov assumption: x(t+1) depends only on the 
preceding n-1 words
𝑃 𝑥 𝑡+1 |𝑥 𝑡 , … , 𝑥 1 = 𝑃 𝑥 𝑡+1 |𝑥 𝑡 , … , 𝑥 𝑡−𝑛+2

n-gram Language Models

𝑃 𝑥 𝑡+1 |𝑥 𝑡 , … , 𝑥 𝑖−1
• Definition: An n-gram model predicts the next word based on the 
previous (n-1) words.
• Example sentence: "I have a dog whose name is Lucy. I have two 
cats, they like playing with Lucy. "
• Key concept: Collect statistics on n-gram frequencies to predict 
the next word
• Process:
• Step 1: Identify sequences of n words (n-grams) in the text
• Step 2: Calculate the probability of each n-gram
• Step 3: Use probabilities to predict the next word
--- Page 48 ---
Unigram probability
Introduction to AI, ML, and LLMs 48
• “I have a dog whose name is Lucy. I have two cats, they like 
playing with Lucy. ”
• corpus size m = 17
• P(Lucy) = 2/17; P(cats) = 1/17
• Unigram probability:
